Main elements to complete:

- Public github and published page - react on github pages - done
- Mobile first (320px-450px) - done
- An input box that adds to do items to the main container when + button is pressed
- When task is completed and user clickes on list item, it checks the box and puts a line through the text
- A bin icon on the list item that removed the item from the list
- Reset button that clears the list
